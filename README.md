# relativeprimes
This generates a ton of relative prime pairs uses the ratio of relative primes to non-relative prime pairs to approximate pi.

Crazy.

See Basel's Problem for more information.

Runs a bit slow because primes are homegrown with the a pretty straightforward implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Could go faster with a hardcoded array, but if practicality was the goal I wouldn't have coded this in the first place.
